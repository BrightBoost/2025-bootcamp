## Database Design Assignment for E-Commerce Platform

The goal of this assignment is to design a database for an e-commerce platform specializing in selling computer cables like HDMI, USB-C, and others. You will create the necessary tables, define the relationships between them, and illustrate your design with a few records.

Instructions:

1. Identify necessary tables:
- Determine the tables required to store information about products, customers, orders, and any other relevant data.

2. Define columns for each table:
- Specify the columns each table will have, including the data type and any constraints (e.g., primary key, foreign key, unique, not null).

3. Establish Relationships Between Tables:
- Identify the relationships between the tables, such as one-to-many or many-to-many relationships, and establish the necessary foreign key constraints.

Draw the tables:
- Create a diagram showing the tables, their columns, and the relationships between them. Include one or two records in each table to illustrate how data will be stored. (e.g. use a tool such as [drawing tool](https://draw.io))

Deliverables:
- A document containing the list of tables, their columns, and relationships.
- A diagram illustrating the database design.
