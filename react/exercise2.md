## Recreate the Shelter App from yesterday in a Vite React app

### Steps:
1.  Create a New React App with Vite. The project folder is called "my-app".

    ```
    $ npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

    ```
    $ cd my-app
    $ npm install
    ```

3.  Start the Application:

    ```
    $ npm run dev
    ```

4. Migrate the components and images 

This requires multiple steps, including:
- Creating a `components` folder in `src`;
- Creating a `.jsx` file per component;
- Replacing the content of `App.jsx` and adding imports where necessary.
