# 🐾 Animal shelter React page

Your task is to build a React app that displays a list of adorable animals up for adoption to help them find a home. 

You can specialize in any type of animal, real and imaginary. Whether it's dogs, cats, hedgehogs, turtles, birds, crickets, or dragons 🐶🐱🐢🐦🐉

## The steps 

1. **Create an `Animal` Component 🐾**
   - Each animal should have:
     - A **name**
     - **Age**
     - **Species**
     - **A list of fun fact** (e.g., "Loves belly rubs" 🐶 or "Can sing opera" 🎶)
     - **An image** of the animal (use online links or placeholders)

2. **Create an `AnimalList` Component 📜**
   - This component should:
     - Hold an **array of animals** (at least 3)
     - Use `.map()` to display each animal using the `Animal` component

3. **Render Everything on the Page 📢**
   - Make sure your shelter displays all the available animals.

4. **Style the app** using CSS.
   - Make the app look pretty with the use of CSS. You can find explanation on how to do that on the W3Schools website.


### Bonus
1. **Add a "Adopt Me!" button** next to each animal.
2. **Display "Found a home!" banners** make it clear that an animal is already adopted.
4. **Input new animals** via a form.
